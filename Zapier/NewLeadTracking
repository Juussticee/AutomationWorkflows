That's excellent\! Providing the detailed setup screens gives us all the information needed to create a comprehensive and useful GitHub README.

Here is the drafted **README.md** template for your Zapier workflow, structured for clarity and ease of replication.

# 🤖 Webhook Data Logger & Slack Notifier Zap

This Zapier workflow automatically processes data received via a webhook, posts a clear notification to a designated Slack channel, and updates a corresponding row in a Google Sheet for logging and tracking purposes.

## 🖼️ Workflow Overview



## 🎯 Goal

To create a robust, end-to-end automation pipeline for tracking customer appointment bookings from an external system.

## 🛠️ Applications Used

1.  **Webhooks by Zapier** (Trigger)
2.  **Slack** (Action)
3.  **Google Sheets** (Action)

-----

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1\. Trigger: Webhooks by Zapier - Catch Raw Hook

This step listens for a raw HTTP POST request from an external system (e.g., your booking platform).

| Setting | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **App & Event** | **Webhooks by Zapier** - Catch Raw Hook |
| **Key Requirement** | The external system must send a POST request to the unique URL provided by Zapier. |
| **Required Payload** | The data payload must include fields for: **Name**, **Link**, **Appointment Time**, and **Closer** (or whatever fields you need for your Sheet/Slack). |

### 2\. Action: Slack - Send Channel Message

This step uses the data received from the webhook to generate an immediate, user-friendly notification in Slack.

| Setting | Value / Mapping |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Action Event** | Send Channel Message |
| **Message Text** | **Appointment booked\!**<br>Name: `{{1.Name}}`<br>Link: `{{1.Link}}`<br>Appointment Time: `{{1.Appointment Time}}` |
| **Send as a bot?** | **Yes** |
| **Bot Name** | *(Specify a bot name here, e.g., 'Appointment Bot')* |
| **Include a link to this Zap?** | No |

### 3\. Action: Google Sheets - Update Spreadsheet Row(s)

This step updates an existing row in your Google Sheet, likely to update the status or details of a record based on the received data.

| Setting | Value / Mapping |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Action Event** | Update Spreadsheet Row(s) |
| **Spreadsheet** | **CsutomerAppt** |
| **Worksheet** | **Sheet1** |
| **Row Number\*** | Mapped from a previous step (must contain the unique identifier/row number of the record to update). |
| **Name** | `{{1.Name}}` (Mapped from Webhook) |
| **Appt Time** | `{{1.Appointment Time}}` (Mapped from Webhook) |
| **Contact Link** | `{{1.Link}}` (Mapped from Webhook) |
| **Closer** | `{{1.Closer}}` (Mapped from Webhook) |

> **💡 Note:** The `Update Spreadsheet Row(s)` action requires you to have a **Row Number**. This implies you likely have a previous step (or a Search Step, which you did not include) that *searches* for the existing row based on a unique ID (like a booking ID) received in the webhook. If you use the search step, you should document that here.

## 🚀 How to Implement This Zap

1.  **Create/Configure Sheets:** Ensure you have a Google Sheet named **CsutomerAppt** with columns that match the fields being mapped (`Name`, `Appt Time`, `Contact Link`, `Closer`).
2.  **Create New Zap:** Start a new Zap in Zapier and choose **Webhooks by Zapier** as the trigger.
3.  **Test Trigger:** Copy the webhook URL provided by Zapier and send a sample payload from your external system to test the trigger and pull in sample data.
4.  **Configure Actions:** Set up the **Slack** and **Google Sheets** steps, mapping the data fields (e.g., `{{1.Name}}`) from the webhook step into the appropriate Slack message and Sheet columns.
5.  **Turn On:** Activate the Zap\!
